### Abstract

_OSC-Qasm_Â is a cross-platform, Python-based, OSC interface for executing Qasm code. It serves as a simple way to connect creative programming environments like Max (withÂ _The QAC Toolkit_) and Pure Data with real quantum hardware, using the Open Sound Control protocol. In this paper, the authors introduce the context and meaning of developing a tool like this, and what it can offer to creative artists.
