This event has marked the launch of the [[ðŸ“” Quantum Computer Music - Foundations, Methods and Advanced Concepts]] book, and also featured the (probably) first concert in which there was a real-time connection and dedicated communication with Real Quantum Hardware from IBMQ.

It was also the occasion the [[ðŸ’¾ Q1synth]] was first used on stage for one of the pieces.

The audience that day counted with the presence of people of interest, such as the acclaimed composers Brian Eno and Peter Gabriel, and also the then CEO of Quantinuum, Ilyas Khan.

The event was organised by Moth Quantum
